            <h2>A Legacy That Roars</h2> 
            <p>Founded in 1901, Royal Enfield is one of the oldest motorcycle manufacturers 
in the world. It quickly earned a reputation for durability and strength, even being used by 
soldiers during wartime. Over the years, the brand has evolved but maintained its legacy 
as a symbol of rugged adventure and reliability. Today, it stands as an iconic name in both 
the Indian and international motorcycle markets.

            <h2>Timeless Design and Iconic Models</h2> 
            <p>Royal Enfield’s design is what sets it apart. Its classic styling, complete with 
smooth lines, chrome finishes, and vintage looks, evokes nostalgia while offering modern 
functionality. The Classic 350, for instance, balances old-school charm with updated 
features, while the Meteor 350 is a sleek, modern cruiser that offers a smooth, relaxed ride. 
 
For those with an adventurous spirit, the Himalayan stands as the ultimate choice. With its 
off-road capabilities and comfortable touring features, it's built to conquer any terrain. The 
Interceptor 650 and Continental GT 650 are newer models that offer a twin-cylinder engine 
for added performance, while still maintaining that unmistakable Royal Enfield flair.

events like Rider Mania, and long-distance adventures like the Himalayan Odyssey allow 
fans to connect, share stories, and celebrate their passion for motorcycles. Royal Enfield 
isn’t just a motorcycle; it’s a lifestyle that creates lasting friendships and unforgettable
